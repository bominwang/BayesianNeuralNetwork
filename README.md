# BayesianNeuralNetwork
This project implements a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using PyTorch. A BNN is a type of neural network that treats model weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. This allows for uncertainty estimation in predictions and robustness against overfitting.
