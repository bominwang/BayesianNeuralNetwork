# Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)

## Overview

This project implements a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using PyTorch. A BNN is a type of neural network that treats model weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. This allows for uncertainty estimation in predictions and robustness against overfitting.

## Installation

Before using this code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
